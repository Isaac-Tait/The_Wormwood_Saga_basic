This is a template repo intended to provide some default structure and styles for demo projects. In a nutshell, this provides:

* a styled header
* a footer with configurable links
* a main content area that’s centered
* some generic global defaults (e.g. `box-sizing` reset, CSS variables for fonts, colors, and a few other things)

It’s created with [11ty](https://11ty.dev), but we can always generate the wrapper and copy the built HTML over for use with whatever framework.
